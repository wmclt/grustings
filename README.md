# Rocket Todo Example

This example makes use of a SQLite database via `diesel` to store todo tasks. As
a result, you'll need to have `sqlite3` and its headers installed:

  * **OS X:** `brew install sqlite`
  * **Debian/Ubuntu:** `apt-get install libsqlite3-dev`
  * **Arch:** `pacman -S sqlite`


# Our Idea
Turn this code example in to a chat application. The original code comes from the `/examples/todo` folder of the [Rocket framework's repository](https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/).
